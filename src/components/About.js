            <p>
                I am a fullstack web developer. From the very beginning of my
                programming journey I fell in love with it, it was absalutaly
                clear that this is what I want want to do for the rest of my
                life.
            </p>
            <p>
                I give great accent to website design and its uniqueness. My
                conviction is that every website should stand out and give an
                idea about what it represents from the first sight. Having art
                background is helping me to do this on high level.
            </p>
            <p>
                I <span>love</span> what i do and it can be seen in my work.
            </p>
        </div>
